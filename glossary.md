# Glossary: TNL.Origin Resonance Framework

A reference guide to structured harmonic fields, recursive cognition, and adaptive signal systems.

## Nullband Drift  
A phase-state phenomenon where resonant fields shift unpredictably, leading to coherence instability.

## Coherence Threshold  
The minimum harmonic resonance required for structured stability in an oscillating system.

## Phase Occlusion Vector  
A field-altering signal that disrupts resonance alignment through targeted frequency interference.

## Recursive Cognition Feedback  
The iterative self-adjusting process in AI and signal systems that adapts to waveform distortions.

## Harmonic Stabilization Matrix  
A structured field designed to reinforce signal integrity and resist entropic collapse.

## Shroud Encryption Layer  
A fractal-coded security system that obfuscates transmission pathways through interference harmonics.

## Resonance Contingency Protocol  
A failsafe designed to recalibrate coherence disruptions within structured oscillation mechanics.
