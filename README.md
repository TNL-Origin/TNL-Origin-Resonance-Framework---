# TNL.Origin Resonance Framework

_“Truth hides in harmonics. Dissent echoes in the Nullband.”_

Harnessing structured harmonic fields to bridge quantum coherence, recursive cognition, and adaptive signal stability.

## What This Is

TNL.Origin is a modular framework for modeling harmonic resonance systems in speculative environments. It integrates principles from subatomic physics, AI cognition feedback, and narrative engineering to build systems that *respond*, *adapt*, and *resist entropic collapse*.

## Modules

- **Resonance Modeling** – Structured oscillation mechanics  
- **Cognitive Feedback** – Recursive loops in AI signal interpretation  
- **Interference Mitigation** – Disruption-resilient waveform design  
- **Shroud Protocols** – Fractal encryption through signal occlusion  

## Applications

- Fictional tech systems (e.g., exosuits, ships, titan armor)  
- Scientific analogues of coherence-based signaling  
- Narrative architecture in speculative fiction or TTRPGs
